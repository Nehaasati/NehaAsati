👩‍💻 Hi, I’m Neha Asati – A Passionate Data Scientist & Backend Developer  
📍 Based in Sweden | 🌍 Originally from India
🔭 I’m currently working on  on pdfchatbot on agentic ai

🌱 I’m currently pursuing internship in Extellio as a data scientist, Malmö

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Data science

🤝 I am actively looking for Internships/Jobs in Sweden If you're hiring or know about opportunities, let's connect!

👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at https://github.com/Nehaasati
🚀 I have technical experience and interest in:
- Deep Learning (CNNs, Transfer Learning, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras)
- Machine Learning (Classification, Feature Selection, Model Optimization)
- Computer Vision (Image Classification, Malaria Detection, VGG16, ANN)
- Natural Language Processing** (Spacy, Gensim, Flair, Transformers)
- MLOps(Efficient pipelines, deployment, monitoring, and automation)


 🔧 What I’ve Worked On:
🧠 Data Scientist at IZISS Technologies
- Built and optimized ML models for credit card fraud detection using advanced preprocessing, pipeline automation, and performance tuning.
- Developed deep learning models(ANNs and CNNs) to extract intelligent insights from complex datasets.


 🦠 Malaria Detection 
- Built a CNN-based model using VGG16 and TensorFlow to detect malaria from cell images with high accuracy.
- Enhanced model performance using data augmentation and transfer learning.

 🛠️ Backend Developer at Ecombooster 
- Developed backend systems and REST APIs using Django and Django REST Framework.
- Implemented test-driven development practices and file export functionality using Python.
- Built scalable APIs to support business intelligence workflows and platform automation

️ Tools & Technologies I Use:
Languages**: Python, SQL  
ML/DL**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Spacy, Gensim  
Backend**: Django, Django REST, Flask  
DevOps & Testing**: Java,Git, Bitbucket Pipelines, JIRA, Selenium, Unit Testing  
Data Engineering**: Pandas, NumPy, Scipy  
Others**: css3 figma git html5 java javascript linux mysql nodejs react sass selenium

 🎯 My Focus Now:
- Integrating LLMs (Large Language Models) with ML workflows.
- Building ML-powered APIs** for anomaly detection, traffic analysis, and user segmentation.
- Exploring causality in ML** and fine-tuning models for production-readiness (MLOps, monitoring, explainability).
